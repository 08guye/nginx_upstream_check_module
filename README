Healthcheck plugin for nginx.  It polls backends and if they respond with
HTTP 200 + an optional request body, they are marked good.  Otherwise, they
are marked bad.

For help on all the options, see the docblocks inside the .c file where each
option is defined.

Note this also gives you access to a health status page that lets you see
how well your healthcheck are doing.


:::::Important:::::
Nginx gives you full freedom which server peer to pick when you write an
upstream.  This means that the healthchecking plugin is only a tool that
other upstreams must know about to use.  So your upstream code MUST SUPPORT
HEALTHCHECKS.  It's actually pretty easy to modify the code to support them.

See the .h file for how as well as the upstream_hash patch which shows
how to modify upstream_hash to support healthchecks.
